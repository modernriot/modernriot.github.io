        , you'll first have to create and account and username. Your username will become your file repository that you'll be uploading your html and resource files into, to view on the web. After you have created an Git account, create a repository, name it 'yourusername.github.io' and move on to Visual Studio , create an html file. Any media files will need to be organized in your directory as indicated in your code.
